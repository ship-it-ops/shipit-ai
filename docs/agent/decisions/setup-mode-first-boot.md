# First-boot SETUP MODE: trigger contract, derivation overlay, restart flip

## Context

A fresh GKE deploy was unbootable: committed `shipit.config.yaml` is
safe-by-default (auth on, no providers, `admins: []`) and
`assertAuthConfigBootable` killed the api-server before the onboarding
wizard — the thing that mints the GitHub OAuth client into GSM — could
run. Cross-repo brief 2026-06-11.

## Decision

1. **Trigger** (`packages/api-server/src/index.ts`): boot into setup mode
   only when the bootability check fails AND (`gsm` store with zero
   hydrated secrets, OR `gsm` store with every failing gate
   wizard-fixable, OR `SHIPIT_FORCE_SETUP_MODE=1` dev escape hatch).
   Gate taxonomy lives in `auth-bootability.ts`: `provider`/`admins` are
   wizard-fixable; `allowedOrigins`/`sessionSecret` are operator-only and
   always fail loud. The wizard-fixable widening exists so a pod restart
   mid-wizard (secrets partially persisted) re-enters setup instead of
   crash-looping.
2. **Surface**: in setup mode only `/api/health` (readiness, reports
   `mode: "setup"`), `/api/setup/*`, and the GitHub App manifest flow
   respond; everything else 401s `SETUP_MODE` (see
   `middleware/require-auth.ts` `SETUP_PUBLIC_PATHS`). Allow-listed
   requests get a synthesized `provider: 'setup'`, role-admin principal.
3. **Durability**: the first admin email is a new writable logical secret
   `auth-admin-emails` (GSM container `shipit-auth-admin-emails`,
   hydrates to `SHIPIT_AUTH_ADMINS`) — GSM because
   `shipit.config.local.yaml` is an ephemeral emptyDir in v1.
4. **Flip without config edits**: `applyDerivedAuthConfig` runs after
   every `loadConfig()` at boot — gsm + OAuth client id+secret in env →
   `providers.github.enabled = true`; `SHIPIT_AUTH_ADMINS` fills empty
   `admins[]`. `POST /api/setup/complete` re-validates a fresh load and
   then `process.exit(0)`; k8s `restartPolicy: Always` reboots into
   enforced auth.
5. **Scope v1**: GitHub provider only; OIDC stays a post-setup admin task.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Hot-swap auth in-process after wizard**: rejected — providers,
  session store, and middleware are wired at boot; restart is the clean
  boundary.
- **Manual operator restart after wizard**: rejected — brief asked for a
  no-manual-step flip.
- **Disable auth on first deploy**: rejected — violates safe-by-default.

## Consequences

- Setup mode is deliberately unauthenticated: whoever reaches the ingress
  on a genuinely-fresh deployment claims admin. Bounded by the
  401-everything-else posture and the mode permanently ending at first
  successful complete.
- **Infra dependency**: Terraform must create the
  `shipit-auth-admin-emails` GSM container + pod GSA addVersion/access
  grants before this works on-cluster.
- web-ui gained a public `/setup` page; login page probes `/api/health`
  and hands off to it when `mode === 'setup'`.

## Revisit Triggers

- Postgres config store lands (replaces GSM-as-config-store for admins).
- OIDC-first deployments requested → widen wizard scope.
- Multi-tenant SaaS: setup-claims-admin model must be rethought.
